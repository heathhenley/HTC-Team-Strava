# Strava Stats
Aggregating and comparing stats for our 2025 [Hood to Coast](https://hoodtocoast.com/) team - and
giving me a chance to play with [convex.dev](https://convex.dev).

If you are from Strava reading this - thanks for approving our app!

# Running the app
1. Clone the repo
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev` for the front end (vite react/typescript)
4. `npx convex dev` for the backend (convex.dev) (you will need to have a convex.dev account)
