# Stava Stats
Aggregating and comparing stats for our Hood to Coast team - and
giving me a chance to play with [convex.dev](https://convex.dev).

If you are from strava reading this - please approve my app!
- we will have no more than 10-15 users (the team)
- most of us are premium strava users anyway
- there is no commercial intent
- we followed all the brand guidelines

# Running the app
1. Clone the repo
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev` for the front end (vite react/typescript)
4. `npx convex dev` for the backend (convex.dev) (you will need to have a convex.dev account)
